## Part 1: Website Description

My Personal Jellyfish  is an interactive website designed to bring a virtual jellyfish companion to life. Its goal is to create a fun and engaging experience where users can connect with a friendly jellyfish character. Through a chat interface, users can send messages to the jellyfish and receive thoughtful responses, making the interaction feel like a real conversation. To add a playful touch, the jellyfish also follows the user’s cursor movements, giving it a lifelike and interactive quality, as well as a live clock that displays the current time, enhancing the sense of connection and real-time engagement.

This website is perfect for anyone who loves aquatic life, enjoys creative technology, or appreciates charming character design. The calming, mesmerizing jellyfish aesthetic combined with the playful interactivity makes it especially appealing. It’s also great for those seeking a unique digital companion or a soothing, low-pressure way to unwind, offering a relaxing and memorable experience. It’s not just about observing—it’s about connecting, making it a comforting and fun escape from everyday life.



## Part 2: User Interaction

On the My Personal Jellyfish website, users can enjoy a variety of interactive features that bring their virtual jellyfish companion to life. The primary way to engage is through the chat interface, where users can type messages into a text box and press “Enter” or click the “Send” button to initiate a conversation. The jellyfish responds to these messages, creating a dynamic and personalized interaction. Another playful feature is cursor tracking, where the jellyfish’s gaze follows the user’s mouse movements across the screen. This adds a fun, lifelike quality to the experience, making the jellyfish feel responsive and engaged. Additionally, a live clock is displayed prominently on the page, showing the current time in real-time. This feature doesn’t require any interaction but enhances the immersive experience by grounding it in the present moment. Together, these interactions—chatting, cursor tracking, and the real-time clock—make the website a unique and captivating space for users to connect with their digital jellyfish friend. The simple yet creative design encourages users to explore and enjoy the calming, interactive environment.

## Part 3: External Tool

p5.js

p5.js is great for creative visuals and animations, and offers intuitive tools for interactive design. Its simplicity and flexibility made it a great fit for creating dynamic effects like cursor-following and smooth animations.
 I used p5.js to animate the jellyfish, create smooth cursor-tracking behavior. It also enabled seamless integration of visual and interactive elements.
p5.js helps me to build quality user experience with visually engaging animations and responsive interactions, making the jellyfish feel lifelike and immersive.

GPT API

The GPT API provides advanced conversational capabilities, allowing natural and context-aware responses. Its accuracy and adaptability made it the best option for creating engaging dialogue with the jellyfish.
 I implemented the GPT API to handle user inputs in the chat interface, generating realistic and meaningful responses from the jellyfish based on specific prompts.
The GPT API adds depth and interactivity by enabling a dynamic conversation with the jellyfish, making the experience feel more personal and engaging.


## Part 4: Design Iteration

Throughout the development, I made several key changes to enhance functionality and user experience. Initially, the jellyfish interaction was limited to basic animations, but I added cursor tracking to make the jellyfish more responsive and lifelike. The chat feature also evolved from static responses to using the GPT API, enabling dynamic and personalized conversations based on user input. This change was inspired by feedback suggesting users would prefer more meaningful interactions. 
I also introduced a live clock to create a stronger connection to real-world cues. These updates helped make the website feel more interactive and immersive. Each iteration aimed to refine the user experience, ultimately transforming the prototype into an engaging, polished final product.


## Part 5: Implementation Challenge

One major challenge was integrating the GPT API for the chat feature, as it required careful handling of asynchronous requests to ensure smooth and timely responses. This involved understanding how to manage API calls efficiently without disrupting the user experience. I had to implement error handling to account for scenarios where the API might lag or fail, ensuring the chat feature remained functional and user-friendly. 


## Part 6: Generative AI Use and Reflection

I used ChatGPT throughout the project to assist with brainstorming, coding, and content generation. It helped me refine ideas for the jellyfish interaction, debug code, and write clear descriptions for my project’s features and interactions.

Unfortunately, I don’t have a detailed chat history link to share, but I used prompts like "Suggest ways to make a jellyfish character interactive" and "Help debug API integration issues for a chat feature." These guided me in shaping and refining the final project.
