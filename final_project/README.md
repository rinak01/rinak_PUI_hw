# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## Idea Sketches

### *Idea 1*

![The June 19th Project](images/the_june_19th_project.jpg)

"Personal Project Portfolio" is a personal project website where I showcase one project every year. I want to document and showcase my projects and and how my skills developed over time. I plan to make the design interactive by allowing users to click through different years to see individual projects, each with visuals, descriptions, and technical implementations. To keep it accessible, I’ll ensure high contrast for readability, use accessible fonts, and add descriptive tags to all media for screen readers. I want to convey a sense of development, showing both the successes and challenges of each project to give viewers a well-rounded understanding of my creative and technical skills.

### *Idea 2* 

![Your Personal Jellyfish](images/my_personal_jelyfish.jpg)

"Your Personal Jellyfish" is an interactive website where a virtual pet jellyfish responds to user interactions while displaying live weather and temperature updates. My main focus for engagement is to give the jellyfish character-like qualities—users can tap to get its attention, and it will react by "waving" or moving closer to greet them. To make this accessible, I’ll include screen reader-compatible text for all animations, provide a toggle for simplified visuals, and use a color palette that’s easy on the eyes. Through this design, I want users to feel like the jellyfish is a friendly companion that brings the weather to life in a fun and interactive way.

…

### *Idea 3*

![Cat Care Made Simple](images/cat_care_made_simple.jpg)

"Cat Care Made Simple" is an informational site for first-time cat owners, providing them with essential tips and guides on caring for their new pet. I’ll make the site interactive by organizing content into categories like "Nutrition," "Health," and "Behavior," and tips about emergency care based on personal experience and research. For accessibility, I plan to use a simple layout with large fonts, high-contrast colors, and alternative text for images, so all users can easily navigate and learn. My goal is to include practical information that reassures new cat owners and helps them feel confident in taking care of their new cat. 

…

## Feedback Summary

Summarize all the critiques you received during the lab session (\~300 words).

In my final project design process, I presented three ideas: the "Personal Project Portfolio," a site where I update one project per year; "Your Personal Jellyfish," an interactive site where a pet jellyfish shares things such as weather & temperature and interacts in different ways; and "Cat Care Made Simple," an informational website for first-time cat owners. 

Most of the feedback I got was focused on the first two ideas. For the "Personal Project Portfolio," people were curious about how I plan to organize the projects by year. They asked if I had plans for structure to highlight my progression and whether this format would help the user see my growth over time. I think having a solid organization could really help to present the projects, especially for people who want to see a steady development in my work and wonder about future projects. 

For "Your Personal Jellyfish," feedback leaned more toward the technical and interactive aspects. I got some questions about how the jellyfish would live within a weather application and what my plans are for using an API to display live weather data. I was also offered some creative ideas, like having the jellyfish respond to taps or come close to say "hello." I feel like these details could make the jellyfish feel more like a companion, adding a layer of playfulness and making it more engaging for users.


## Feedback Digestion

Digest the feedback you got in the lab (\~300 words). Indicate which critique you will act on in your next design and why you chose to incorporate/dismiss pieces of critique.

This feedback gave me ideas to consider and focus on, from structuring my portfolio for easy navigation and planning specific, interactive features for my final project. Because I had more ideas on what behaviors for the jellyfish project, I think I'll move forward with that idea. I'll be focusing on responsive interactions like the jellyfish reacting to hovers, clicks, or waving back to say hi. I want to keep ideating and developing interaction designs to build a unique, engaging experience with amazing visuals.
